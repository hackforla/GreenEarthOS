GreenEarthOS is creating a web based resource to make finding the organized climate conference that you are looking for easy. Read our overview How we are going about it We are surveying interested people to find out what criteria will make the conference events database most useful and easy to search. Please take our 15 min Conference Event Criteria Priortization survey. We have collected data on all the climate conferences we could Google. See our work in progress Conference Event list spreadsheet or Tell us about an conference that we don't know about yet!!
